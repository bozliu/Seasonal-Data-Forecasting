# Seasonal-Data-Forecasting
AI6123 Time Series Analysis Project 2 

## Objective
To build a relative accurate model to predict the drug sales time series data.

## Conclusion 

Linear regression model with seasonal and trend features, Holt-Winters model with additive seasonal components, Holt-Winters model with multiplicative seasonal components, and Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model are applied to fit the data or monthly anti-diabetic drug sales in Australia from 1992 to 2008.

To sum up, the Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model, ARIMA(3,0,0) (0,1,2) [12] is selected for the most appropriate model to predict drug sales due to its smallest AIC value, RMSE value, MAE value and Theilâ€™s U value among all the models.
